 <div class="w3-container" style="font-size: 20px;">   
 <p> The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is a pest of great economic importance in several countries in Latin America and the Mediterranean basin. Its primary host is tomato, although potato, aubergine, common bean, physalis and various wild solanaceous plants are also suitable hosts. Tuta absoluta, synonym Gnoromoschema absoluta (Clarke, 1962), Scrobipalpula absoluta (Povolny, 1964) is characterized by a high reproduction potential. Each female may lay up to 300 creamy coloured eggs and 10-12 generations can be produced each year. In tomato, it can attack any plant part at any crop stage and can cause up to 100% crop destruction, although the larvae prefer apical buds, tender new leaflets, flowers, and green fruits.  This pest is crossing borders and devastating tomato production in both protected and open fields. Originating from Latin America, T. absoluta has recently spread via infested fruits and packaging material to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Given its aggressive nature and crop destruction potential, it has quickly become a key pest of concern in these new geographies.
     Infestation of tomato plants occurs throughout the entire crop cycle.</p>
 <p>Feeding damage is caused by all larval instars and throughout the whole plant. On leaves, the larvae feed on the mesophyll tissue, forming irregular leaf mines which may later become necrotic. Larvae can form extensive galleries in the stems which affect the development of the plants. Fruit are also attacked by the larvae, and the entry-ways are used by secondary pathogens, leading to fruit rot. The extent of infestation is partly dependent on the variety. Potential yield loss in tomatoes (quantity and quality) is significant and can reach up to 100% if the pest is not managed.
The basis for effective and sustainable management of Tuta absoluta is the integration of cultural, behavioural, biological and chemical control.</p>
     <span>Key Management Tactics  </span>
     <ul>
<li>Allow a minimum of 6 weeks from crop destruction to planting the next crop to prevent carry-over of the pest from previous crop. </li>
<li>Between planting cycles, cultivate the soil and cover with plastic mulch or perform solarisaon.</li> 
<li>Control weeds to prevent multiplication in alternative weed host (especially Solanum, Datura, Nicoana). </li>
<li> Prior to transplanting, install hardware traps. </li>
<li>Use pest-free transplants.</li> 
<li> Seal greenhouse with high quality nets suitable for T. absoluta. </li>
<li> Place raspberry pi hardware traps to automatically monitor all stages of tomato production, i.e. nurseries, farms, packaging, processing and distribution centers. Start monitoring 2 weeks before planting. </li>
<li>Inspect the crop to detect the first signs of damage. </li>
    <h2>Mode of Action Window Approach: </h2>
<li>The basic rule for adequate rotation of insecticides by mode of action (MoA) is to avoid treang consecutive generations of the target pest with insecticides in the same MoA group, by using a scheme of “MoA treatment windows”. §  A treatment window is here defined as a period of 30 consecutive days, based on the minimum duration of a single generation of T. absoluta. §  Multiple applications of the same MoA or different MoA’s may be possible within a particular window (follow label for maximum number of applications within a window and per crop cycle). §  Aer a first MoA window of 30 days is completed and if additional insecticide applications are needed based on established thresholds, different and effective MoA’s should be selected for use in the next 30 days (second MoA window).  Similarly, a third MoA window should use different MoA’s for the subsequent 30 days etc.  §  The proposed scheme seeks to minimize the selection of resistance to any given MoA group by ensuring that the same insecticide MoA group will not be re-applied for at least 60 days aer a window closes, a wise measure given the potential of a longer life cycle based on temperature fluctuations throughout the growing season.</li> 
<li>This scheme requires a minimum of three effective insecticide MoA groups but ideally more MoA groups should be included, if locally registered and effective against T. absoluta.
<li>Insecticide Resistance Management (IRM): The recommendations for sustaining the effectiveness of available insecticides is centered on integration of as many pest management tools as possible, use of insecticides only when needed based on established thresholds, and rotation of effective insecticides with different modes of action (MoA).</li>

  <h2>Damping Off</h2>
   <img class="w3-card-4" src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/agriculture/crop-production/integrated-pest-managment/ipm-for-vegetables/ipm-strategies-for-tomato/Earlyblight.jpg" alt="Tomato" style="width: 100%;">

 
  <h3>Damage symptom</h3>
<p>Damping off of tomato occurs in two stages, i.e. the pre-emergence and the post-emergence phase.
  In the pre-emergence the phase the seedlings are killed just before they reach the soil surface.
  The young radical and the plumule are killed and there is complete rotting of the seedlings.
  The post-emergence phase is characterized by the infection of the young, juvenile tissues of the collar at the ground level.
  The infected tissues become soft and water soaked. The seedlings topple over or collapse</p>
 
  <h2>Favourable conditions</h2>
  <p>
    High humidity, high soil moisture, cloudiness and low temperatures below 24° C for few days are ideal for infection and development of disease.
    Crowded seedlings, dampness due to high rainfall, poor drainage and excess of soil solutes hamper plant growth and increase the pathogenic damping-off.
    Survival and spread
    Primary: Soil, Seed, Water
    Secondary: Conidia through rain splash or wind.

<div class="w3-container" style="font-size: 20px;">
  <h1>Early blight</h1>
  <h2>Damage symptoms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a common disease of tomato occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth.</li>
    <li>The fungus attacks the foliage causing characteristic leaf spots and blight. Early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage.</li>
    <li>Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area.</li>
    <li>
      Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed.</li>
    <li>This is a common disease of tomato occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth.</li>
    <li>Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line.</li>
    <li>Transplants showing infection by the late blight fungus often die when set in the field. The fungus also infects the fruit, generally through the calyx or stem attachment.</li>
    <li>Lesions attain considerable size, usually involving nearly the entire fruit; concentric rings are also present on the fruit.</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Survival and spread</h2>
  Primary: The fungus spends the winter in infected plant debris in or on the soil where it can survive at least one and perhaps several years. It can also be seed borne.
  Secondary: The spores are transported by water, wind, insects, other animals including man, and machinery. Once the initial infections have occurred, they become the most important source of new spore production and are responsible for rapid disease spread.
  <h2>Favourable conditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Warm, rainy and wet weather</li>
    
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="w3-container" style="font-size: 20px;">
  <h1>Bacterial leaf spot</h1>
  <h2>Damage symptoms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Moist weather and splattering rains are conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occur in the area.</li>
    <li>Infected leaves show small, brown, water soaked, circular spots surrounded with yellowish halo.</li>
    <li>On older plants the leaflet infection is mostly on older leaves and may cause serious defoliation.</li>
    <li>The most striking symptoms are on the green fruit. Small, water-soaked spots first appear which later become raised and enlarge until they are one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter.</li>
    <li>Centers of these lesions become irregular, light brown and slightly sunken with a rough, scabby surface.</li>
    <li>Ripe fruits are not susceptible to the disease. Surface of the seed becomes contaminated with the bacteria, remaining on the seed surface for some time.</li>
    <li>The organism survives in alternate hosts, on volunteer tomato plants and on infected plant debris.</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Survival and spread</h2>
  <P>Primary: Bacterial cells survive on infected plant debris and seed (both internally and externally) and also on solanaceous weeds such as Solanum nigrum</P>
  <p>Secondary: Bacterial cells transmitted through rain splash</p>
  <h2>Favourable conditions</h2>
